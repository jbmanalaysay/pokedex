      I’ve developed a personal website as my take on a PokeDex, designed to provide a comprehensive and interactive
      experience for users. The site is powered by the PokeAPI, which serves as the database, providing detailed
      information about all the Pokémon featured. The frontend of the website is crafted entirely using HTML, CSS, and
      Vanilla JavaScript, ensuring a clean and efficient design without relying on heavy frameworks.
      <br><br>
      One of the standout features of the site is the "Recognizing" tab, which allows users to identify Pokémon through
      advanced vision technology. This functionality is made possible by integrating an API hosted on GroqCloud,
      authenticated via a secure bearer token tied to my account. 
      <br><br>
      The API leverages the state-of-the-art Llama 3.2
      vision model to process and recognize Pokémon images accurately. This combination of APIs and custom development
      makes the PokeDex both visually appealing and functionally robust, reflecting my passion for coding and
      problem-solving.
